# InSpec extra resources

This project is an InSpec resource pack containing new resources for supported OSes. A resource pack is used instead of commiting directly to [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/tree/master/lib/inspec/resources) to make the resources available to all supported versions of InSpec.
